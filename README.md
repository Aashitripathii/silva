# Learning Silvaco for Semiconductor simulation

### **Main Question: What are the statements in Silvaco?**

<img width="980" height="553" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0afc1e6-1c31-4921-b7bf-02be9862d5f8" />


Silvaco simulation is written in a script format where each line is a **statement**.
Each statement describes either the **device structure**, **materials/models**, or the **simulation method**.

---

### **1. Structure Specification**

These statements define the **physical structure of the device**:

* **mesh** → Defines the mesh (grid points) in x and y directions.
* **region** → Defines regions (like substrate, epitaxial layer, oxide, etc.).
* **electrodes** → Specifies electrodes/contacts (like source, drain, gate).
* **doping** → Defines doping profiles (n-type, p-type, concentration, distribution).

✅ Example:

```
doping uniform n.type conc=1e16 region=1
```

Here:

* `doping` = statement
* `uniform` = parameter
* `n.type` = type of dopant
* `conc=1e16` = concentration
* `region=1` = applies to region 1

---

### **2. Materials & Models**

These statements define the **material properties** and **physical models**:

* **material** → Assigns material (Si, SiO₂, GaAs, etc.) to a region.
* **models** → Defines models to include in the simulation (mobility models, recombination, quantum effects, etc.).
* **contact** → Specifies boundary conditions for electrodes.
* **interface** → Defines interface properties (oxide-semiconductor, traps, etc.).

---

### **3. Simulation Method**

These statements control **how the simulation is run**:

* **log** → Opens a file to save simulation results.
* **solve** → Solves equations (Poisson, drift-diffusion, etc.).
* **load** → Loads a previously saved structure/solution.
* **save** → Saves the device state for later use.

---

### **General Statement Format**

```
<statement> <parameters>=<value>
```

Example:

```
doping uniform n.type conc=1e16 region=1
```

---

### **Summary**

* **Structure statements**: mesh, region, electrodes, doping
* **Material/model statements**: material, models, contact, interface
* **Simulation/method statements**: log, solve, load, save

These three together describe:

1. What the device looks like (geometry + doping).
2. What physics to apply (models).
3. How to solve it (simulation flow).

Perfect 👌 This slide is about **defining the mesh in Silvaco TCAD**. Let’s carefully go through it.

---

## 🔹 What is Mesh?

* The **mesh** is the numerical grid used for solving equations (Poisson, drift-diffusion, etc.).
* A **finer mesh** → higher accuracy but more computation time.
* You need to tell Silvaco **where to place mesh lines** along the **x-axis** and **y-axis**, and what the **spacing** should be.

---

## 🔹 Syntax

```
x.mesh location=<value1> spacing=<value2>
y.mesh location=<value3> spacing=<value4>
```

* **x.mesh** → defines grid along x-axis (horizontal).
* **y.mesh** → defines grid along y-axis (vertical).
* **location** → coordinate (in microns usually).
* **spacing** → maximum mesh spacing allowed near that location.

---

## 🔹 Example in Slide

The diagram shows a rectangular device **3 µm (x-direction) × 2 µm (y-direction)** with a mesh grid.

Statements given:

```
x.mesh location=0   spacing=0.1
x.mesh location=3   spacing=0.1

y.mesh location=0   spacing=0.1
y.mesh location=2   spacing=0.1
```

📌 Meaning:

* At **x = 0 µm**, grid spacing = 0.1 µm.
* At **x = 3 µm**, grid spacing = 0.1 µm.
* At **y = 0 µm**, grid spacing = 0.1 µm.
* At **y = 2 µm**, grid spacing = 0.1 µm.

So the simulator divides the rectangle into a **mesh of small squares** (like shown in the figure).

---

## 🔹 Why Different Locations?

You can place more mesh points in **critical areas** (like junctions, depletion regions, thin oxides) by setting **smaller spacing**, and keep coarser mesh in less important regions to save computation time.

Example:

```
x.mesh location=1.0 spacing=0.02   (fine mesh near junction)
x.mesh location=3.0 spacing=0.2    (coarse mesh near contact edge)
```

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Mesh defines the grid resolution in Silvaco.
* Use `x.mesh` and `y.mesh` with `location` and `spacing`.
* Smaller spacing → finer mesh → more accuracy, more computation.
* Place fine mesh near **junctions, interfaces, contacts**.

---

Would you like me to show you a **full mesh script** (x & y mesh definitions for a PN junction example) so you see how it builds the structure step by step?


<img width="1263" height="707" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94418a02-a645-48ca-b60e-583ac87022fb" />

<img width="1157" height="670" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a60f6584-ecd8-4bc5-9b7f-b265f8918c4d" />

Great 👍 These two slides are about **defining regions in Silvaco**. After you set up the **mesh**, you must tell Silvaco what material exists in each portion of the device — these are called **regions**.

---

# 🔹 **Slide 1 Explanation (Basic Region Definition)**

### **Syntax**

```
region num=<integer> <material type> x.min=<value1> x.max=<value2> y.min=<value3> y.max=<value4>
```

* **num** → region number (unique integer for each region).
* **material type** → semiconductor/oxide/metal etc. (like silicon, oxide, GaAs, etc.).
* **x.min, x.max, y.min, y.max** → rectangular coordinates defining the region boundaries.

### **Example in Slide**

```
region num=1 silicon x.min=0 x.max=3 y.min=0 y.max=2
```

👉 This creates **Region 1**, filled with **Silicon**, spanning:

* from **x = 0 to 3 µm**
* from **y = 0 to 2 µm**

So you get a rectangle (like the drawn box) which Silvaco interprets as a block of **silicon material**.

---

# 🔹 **Slide 2 Explanation (Multiple Regions & Advanced Materials)**

### **Multiple Regions**

You can stack multiple regions side by side (or top/bottom) to build **heterostructures** or **layered devices**.

Example:

```
region num=1 x.min=0   x.max=1.5 y.min=0 y.max=2 material=silicon
region num=2 x.min=1.5 x.max=3   y.min=0 y.max=2 material=geranium
```

📌 This divides the rectangle into:

* **Left half (0–1.5 µm)** → Silicon
* **Right half (1.5–3 µm)** → Germanium

So now, the device has **two regions of different materials**.

---

### **Conductors**

Regions can also be **metals** (e.g., Aluminum, Gold, Iron, Silver). These are often used for **electrodes**.
Example:

```
region num=3 aluminum x.min=0 x.max=3 y.min=2 y.max=2.5
```

→ Adds an aluminum contact above the semiconductor.

---

### **Ternary Semiconductors (Compound Materials)**

For alloys like **AlGaAs**, you need to specify **composition**.

* Formula: AlₓGa₁₋ₓAs
* You set **x** with parameter `x.comp`.

Example from slide:

```
region num=1 x.min=0 x.max=3 y.min=0 y.max=2 material=AlGaAs x.comp=0.3
```

👉 This creates **Al₀.₃Ga₀.₇As** in the defined region.

---

# ✅ **Summary**

* **Slide 1** → Basics of defining a region with **material type + coordinates**.
* **Slide 2** → Multiple regions, metallic regions (conductors), and ternary semiconductor alloys using composition.

---
<img width="995" height="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cae8750-d96f-4df0-b54e-a9be9ed9533c" />

Perfect 👍 now we’re at the **Electrode statement** in Silvaco. This is super important because electrodes define where you **apply voltages, currents, or boundary conditions** in the device.

---

## 🔹 **Electrode Statement Format**

```
electrode name=<electrode_name> <position parameters>
```

* **name** → a label for the electrode (like an identifier).
  Examples: `anode`, `cathode`, `gate`, `source`, `drain`.
* **position parameters** → where the electrode is located.
  Options: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`.

---

## 🔹 **Example**

```
electrode name=anode   left
electrode name=cathode right
```

This places:

* **Anode** on the **left side** of the device.
* **Cathode** on the **right side** of the device.

You could also define electrodes on **top or bottom surfaces**.

---

## 🔹 **Multiple Electrodes with the Same Name**

This is the concept mentioned in your slide.

👉 If you write **multiple electrode statements with the same name**, Silvaco treats them as **electrically connected**.

For example:

```
electrode name=gate top x.min=0.5 x.max=1.0
electrode name=gate top x.min=1.0 x.max=1.5
```

* These are **two separate physical gate regions** on the top surface.
* But since both have the **same name = gate**, the simulator treats them as **one electrically connected gate**.

This is useful when:

* You want a **continuous electrode** but defined in parts (maybe due to complex geometry).
* You want to **short multiple contacts** together.

---

## ✅ **Summary**

* **Electrode statement** defines contact placement.
* Position = `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` (+ optional ranges like `x.min`, `x.max`).
* **Same name electrodes** = treated as **electrically connected nodes**.

---

<img width="786" height="360" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2499217f-6fc6-4a4e-8cb4-e62ef05f391d" />

<img width="812" height="436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4498c2b-94fd-4b9a-ace4-a4dfb8937e0d" />

Perfect — you’ve shared your handwritten notes on **doping in Silvaco**. Let me explain the concepts step by step so you get both the **physics behind it** and the **syntax meaning** in Silvaco simulation.

---

## 🔹 1. What is Doping in Semiconductors?

* **Doping** means intentionally introducing impurity atoms into a semiconductor to change its electrical properties.
* Two types of dopants:

  * **n-type** → adds electrons (donor atoms like Phosphorus, Arsenic).
  * **p-type** → adds holes (acceptor atoms like Boron).

In simulation, we need to **define how these dopants are distributed spatially** (uniform, Gaussian, etc.) and with what **concentration**.

---

## 🔹 2. General Syntax in Silvaco

```
doping <distribution.type> <dopant.type> conc=<value> <position parameters>
```

### Components:

1. **Distribution type**

   * `uniform` → Same concentration everywhere in defined region.
   * `gaussian` → Concentration peaks at a point and decays in Gaussian form.
   * `erfc` (complementary error function) → Used to model diffusion-like profiles.

2. **Dopant type**

   * `n.type`
   * `p.type`

3. **Concentration** (`conc`)

   * Typically in cm⁻³, e.g. `1e18`.

4. **Position parameters**

   * Defines region where doping is applied, e.g. `x.min, x.max, y.min, y.max`.

---

## 🔹 3. Uniform Doping Example

```
doping uniform n.type conc=1e18 x.min=0 x.max=3 y.min=0 y.max=2
```

👉 Meaning:

* n-type dopants with uniform concentration **10¹⁸ cm⁻³**.
* Applied to region: `0 ≤ x ≤ 3` and `0 ≤ y ≤ 2`.

This creates a **constant background doping** across that rectangle.

---

## 🔹 4. Gaussian Doping

Gaussian distribution is used when doping peaks at a surface or a line and gradually decreases with depth (like after ion implantation + diffusion).

Mathematical form:

$$
N(y) = N_{peak} \cdot \exp\left[-\left(\frac{y}{char}\right)^2 \right]
$$

* **`char` (characteristic length)** → defines how spread out the Gaussian is.
* Standard deviation = $\frac{char}{\sqrt{2}}$.
* **`peak`** defines max concentration (center of Gaussian).

### Example:

```
doping gaussian conc=1e18 characteristic=0.05 p.type x.left=0 x.right=1 peak=0.1
```

👉 Meaning:

* p-type Gaussian doping.
* Peak concentration = `1e18 cm⁻³`.
* Spread defined by `characteristic=0.05`.
* Applied in x-direction between 0 and 1, with Gaussian peak centered.
* Peak line: `y=0.1`.

This simulates **localized implant near the surface**.

---

## 🔹 5. Complementary Error Function (erfc)

Used to approximate **diffused doping profiles** (after thermal diffusion).

Form:

$$
N(y) = N_{surf} \cdot \text{erfc}\left(\frac{y}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)
$$

(where D is diffusivity, t is time).
This gives a gradually decaying profile from the surface into the bulk.

---

## 🔹 Summary of Use-Cases

* **Uniform** → background doping, wells.
* **Gaussian** → implant profiles, junctions.
* **erfc** → diffusion from surface into bulk.

---

✨ So, in Silvaco, you are essentially **defining how dopants are placed inside the simulated structure** — and each distribution type matches a real-world process (implant, diffusion, background doping).

<img width="837" height="580" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a486d22-7879-49c3-af44-d3d63927a229" />

Got it 👍
This page from your notes lists the **key material properties** you need to define in **Silvaco** (or any semiconductor modeling). Let’s go through each one carefully and prepare clean notes.

The topic here is **“Contact” in semiconductor device simulations** (like TCAD). A *contact* defines how the external circuit connects to the semiconductor.

The slide lists **three types of contacts**:

---

### **1. Ohmic Contact (Default)**

* **Condition**: Dirichlet boundary condition → potential (Vs), electron concentration (ns), and hole concentration (ps) are fixed at the boundary.
* **Meaning**: The contact behaves like a perfect conductor with no barrier, so carriers can flow freely in and out.
* **Use**: Standard source/drain contacts in MOSFETs or electrodes in general devices.
* **Key idea**: Current flows linearly with applied voltage (like a resistor).

---

### **2. Schottky Contact**

* **Formed by**: A **metal contact on a lightly doped semiconductor** (instead of heavily doped, which gives ohmic).
* **Condition**: Barrier is formed due to **workfunction difference** between metal and semiconductor.
* **Example in slide**:

  ```
  Contact name=gate workfunction=4.8
  ```

  → Here, the contact is a gate electrode with workfunction = 4.8 eV.
* **Key idea**: This contact allows rectifying behavior (like a diode), not free carrier flow as in Ohmic.

---

### **3. Floating Contact**

* **Condition**: No electrical connection (acts like an isolated terminal).
* **Example in slide**:

  ```
  Contact name=gate floating
  ```
* **Use**: When you want to simulate an isolated electrode, e.g., floating gate in flash memory.
* **Key idea**: It does not fix potential or carrier density — left “floating”.

---

✅ **In summary:**

* **Ohmic Contact** → Free carrier flow (default, heavily doped).
* **Schottky Contact** → Rectifying barrier due to metal-semiconductor junction.
* **Floating Contact** → No defined potential, isolated terminal.

---


<img width="1128" height="620" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52117200-2089-43ed-973d-71187faffda8" />

Great — this one is about **Interfaces in semiconductor simulations (Silvaco/TCAD)**.
An *interface* is where **two materials meet** (e.g., semiconductor/oxide, semiconductor/semiconductor). The physics at this junction affects device performance significantly.

This slide lists the **key interface models** you can define:

---

### **1. QF → Fixed Charge Density**

* Represents **fixed charges trapped at the interface** (e.g., oxide-semiconductor interface).
* These charges shift the electrostatics, affecting threshold voltage, band bending, etc.
* **Example in slide**:

  ```
  Interface QF = 3.1e10 x.min=1 x.max=2 y.min=0 y.max=5
  ```

  → This defines an interface region with a fixed charge density of $3.1 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm}^{-2}$.

---

### **2. Thermionic → Carrier Transport**

* Defines **carrier transport mechanism** across the interface.
* Here, transport is modeled as **thermionic emission** (carriers hopping over an energy barrier due to thermal energy).
* Important for **heterojunctions** (metal-semiconductor, semiconductor-semiconductor with band offsets).

---

### **3. S.N → Electron Surface Recombination Velocity**

* Parameter to define **how quickly electrons recombine** at the interface.
* High recombination velocity means more carrier loss at the interface, lowering performance (important in solar cells, MOSFETs).

---

### **4. S.P → Hole Surface Recombination Velocity**

* Same as S.N, but for **holes** instead of electrons.
* Again, defines the **trap-assisted recombination** of holes at the interface.

---

✅ **In summary:**

* **QF** = Trapped/Fixed charges at interface.
* **Thermionic** = Carrier transport across interface by thermionic emission.
* **S.N** = Electron recombination velocity at interface.
* **S.P** = Hole recombination velocity at interface.

These are critical parameters to accurately simulate **MOS structures, heterojunction devices, solar cells, and high-k dielectrics**.

---

Would you like me to also give you a **real device example** (like MOS capacitor or solar cell) showing how each of these interface effects shows up in practice?

Perfect 👍 Let’s connect each **interface parameter** to **real device examples** so you see where they matter in practice:

---

## **1. QF → Fixed Charge Density**

📌 **Device Example: MOS Capacitor / MOSFET**

* At the **Si–SiO₂ interface**, fixed oxide charges (QF) can shift the **threshold voltage (Vth)**.
* If positive charges are trapped, they **attract electrons**, lowering Vth (device turns on too easily).
* If negative charges dominate, they **repel electrons**, raising Vth.
  ✅ Engineers compensate for QF by adjusting doping or oxide processing.

---

## **2. Thermionic → Carrier Transport**

📌 **Device Example: Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT)** or **Metal-Semiconductor Schottky Diode**

* At a **heterojunction interface** (e.g., GaAs/AlGaAs), carriers must cross a **band offset**.
* Transport happens via **thermionic emission** — carriers with enough thermal energy jump across the barrier.
* In Schottky diodes, this explains why current follows the **thermionic emission equation** instead of Ohm’s law.

---

## **3. S.N → Electron Surface Recombination Velocity**

📌 **Device Example: Solar Cell (Si/SiO₂ Passivation Layer)**

* Electrons reaching the surface may recombine at traps.
* High recombination velocity → **loss of generated carriers** → lower efficiency.
* Surface passivation (with oxide, nitride, or Al₂O₃) **reduces S.N**, boosting performance.

---

## **4. S.P → Hole Surface Recombination Velocity**

📌 **Device Example: LED or Solar Cell**

* Similar to S.N, but for **holes**.
* In solar cells, high S.P reduces **open-circuit voltage (Voc)**.
* In LEDs, high hole recombination at interfaces lowers **internal quantum efficiency (IQE)**.
* Engineers use passivation and optimized heterostructures to reduce S.P.

---

✨ **Big Picture:**

* **QF** → Shifts device electrostatics (Vth shift in MOS).
* **Thermionic** → Controls carrier injection across barriers (Schottky, HBTs).
* **S.N / S.P** → Define recombination losses (solar cells, LEDs, MOSFET subthreshold slope).

Nice set of slides 👌 These are about the **mathematical framework and numerical methods** used in semiconductor device simulations (like Silvaco, Sentaurus). Let me explain them step by step:

---

## **Slide 1: Semiconductor Equations**

To model a semiconductor device, three main equations are solved:

1. **Poisson’s Equation**

   $$
   \nabla \cdot (\epsilon \nabla \psi) = -q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-)
   $$

   * Relates **electrostatic potential (ψ)** to charge density.
   * Ensures correct band bending due to doping, carriers, and applied voltage.

2. **Electron Continuity Equation**

   $$
   \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{q} \nabla \cdot J_n + G - R
   $$

   * Describes **electron transport and balance**.
   * Includes current flow ($J_n$), generation (G), and recombination (R).

3. **Hole Continuity Equation**

   $$
   \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{q} \nabla \cdot J_p + G - R
   $$

   * Same as above but for **holes**.

✅ Together, these form the **drift-diffusion model**, the backbone of device simulations.

---

## **Slide 2: Methods for Solution**

Different **numerical methods** are used to solve these coupled nonlinear equations:

1. **Gummel Method**

   * **Decoupled solution**: Solve Poisson, electron continuity, and hole continuity one by one in iteration.
   * More stable but slower.
   * Good for initial convergence.
   * Example: `method gummel`

2. **Newton Method**

   * **Coupled solution**: All equations solved simultaneously using Newton-Raphson.
   * Faster and more accurate but requires a good initial guess.
   * Default in Silvaco.

3. **Block Method**

   * Used when adding **extra equations**, e.g. **heat flow equation** (for self-heating effects).
   * Can use Gummel for thermal, Newton for drift-diffusion, etc.

✅ Choice of method affects **convergence speed and stability** in simulation.

---

## **Slide 3: Carrier Options**

When defining “method carriers = …”, you decide **which equations to solve**:

1. **Carriers = 2**

   * Solves for both **electrons and holes**.
   * Used for most devices (MOSFETs, diodes).

2. **Carriers = 1**

   * Solves for one carrier type only (electron OR hole).
   * Example: `method carriers=1 hole` → only hole transport is simulated.
   * Useful for unipolar devices.

3. **Carriers = 0**

   * Only solves **Poisson’s equation** (no transport).
   * Used to compute electrostatics only (e.g., MOS capacitor C–V simulation without current).

---

✅ **In summary:**

* **Equations**: Poisson + continuity (e⁻ + h⁺).
* **Solution methods**:

  * Gummel → decoupled, stable.
  * Newton → coupled, default, faster.
  * Block → for extra physics (thermal, etc.).
* **Carriers**:

  * 2 → full simulation (e⁻ & h⁺).
  * 1 → unipolar.
  * 0 → electrostatics only.

Would you like me to also make a **flowchart-style diagram** showing how Silvaco actually solves these equations step by step? That would make it very easy to visualize.

Perfect 👍 Let’s build a **flowchart-style explanation** of how Silvaco (or any TCAD simulator) solves semiconductor equations step by step:

---

# **Flowchart: Solution Process in Semiconductor Simulation**

### **1. Define Device Structure**

* Geometry (layers, doping, materials).
* Contacts (Ohmic, Schottky, Floating).
* Interfaces (QF, recombination, transport).

---

### **2. Select Physical Models**

* Mobility, recombination, quantum effects, etc.
* Choose transport model (drift-diffusion, hydrodynamic, etc.).

---

### **3. Choose Solution Method**

* **Method carriers = 0 → Only Poisson** (electrostatics).
* **Method carriers = 1 → One carrier (electron or hole).**
* **Method carriers = 2 → Both carriers (full simulation).**

---

### **4. Numerical Solver**

🔹 **Option A: Gummel (Decoupled)**

* Step 1: Solve Poisson (update potential).
* Step 2: Solve electron continuity (update n).
* Step 3: Solve hole continuity (update p).
* Repeat until convergence.

🔹 **Option B: Newton (Coupled)**

* Solve Poisson + electron continuity + hole continuity **together**.
* Faster but requires accurate initial guess.

🔹 **Option C: Block**

* Add extra physics (e.g., heat flow equation).
* Use Gummel for thermal + Newton for carriers.

---

### **5. Convergence Check**

* After each iteration, check error tolerance.
* If not converged → repeat iterations.

---

### **6. Output**

* Potential distribution (ψ).
* Carrier densities (n, p).
* Current densities (Jn, Jp).
* Device characteristics (I–V, C–V, etc.).

---

📌 **Summary Visualization** (textual flow):

```
Device Setup → Physics Models → Method (Carriers=0/1/2) → 
Solver Choice (Gummel/Newton/Block) → Iterations → Convergence → Results
```

<img width="858" height="598" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3676b4c8-f210-4291-a46c-5fc7e5df93cd" />


<img width="667" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc63f46-bb40-42cd-aefb-c33af1a36ed8" />

Perfect 👍 You have shared screenshots of a **Silvaco ATLAS simulation input deck** (`diode.in`) for building and simulating a **PN junction diode**. Let me explain step by step what’s happening, along with the diagram you attached.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Define Mesh

```tcl
x.mesh location=0  spacing=0.1
x.mesh location=10 spacing=0.1
y.mesh location=0  spacing=0.1
y.mesh location=4  spacing=0.1
```

* The **mesh** specifies the grid on which the device is solved numerically.
* X-direction: from **0 to 10 µm** with 0.1 µm spacing.
* Y-direction: from **0 to 4 µm** with 0.1 µm spacing.

👉 This creates a 2D rectangular grid of **10 µm × 4 µm**.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Define the Device Region

```tcl
region number=1 silicon x.min=0 x.max=10 y.min=0 y.max=4
```

* A **silicon region** is created (the diode body).
* Size = **10 µm (length) × 4 µm (width)**.
* This is the **semiconductor device area**.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Define Electrodes (Contacts)

```tcl
electrode name=anode   x.min=1 x.max=9 top
electrode name=cathode x.min=1 x.max=9 bottom
```

* Two electrodes are defined:

  * **Anode (top contact):** placed from x=1 to 9 µm at the **top boundary**.
  * **Cathode (bottom contact):** placed from x=1 to 9 µm at the **bottom boundary**.

👉 These are the metal contacts for biasing.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Define Doping Profiles

```tcl
doping uniform p.type conc=5e15 x.min=0 x.max=10 y.min=0 y.max=2
doping uniform n.type conc=1e16 x.min=0 x.max=10 y.min=2 y.max=4
```

* **P-type region:**

  * From y=0 to y=2 µm (bottom half).
  * Concentration = $5 × 10^{15} \, cm^{-3}$.
* **N-type region:**

  * From y=2 to y=4 µm (top half).
  * Concentration = $1 × 10^{16} \, cm^{-3}$.

👉 Together, this forms a **PN junction diode**:

* **P-region:** bottom half.
* **N-region:** top half.
* Junction located at **y=2 µm**.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Models and Method

```tcl
model bipolar
method newton
```

* **Model bipolar** → includes carrier recombination/generation effects important for diodes.
* **Method newton** → specifies Newton’s method for solving semiconductor equations.

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Biasing and Simulation

```tcl
solve init
solve vcat=0 vanode=0
save outf=diode.str
log outf=diode2.log

solve vcat=0 vanode=-3 vstep=0.1 vfinal=3 name=anode
```

* `solve init` → initializes device solution at equilibrium (no bias).
* `solve vcat=0 vanode=0` → starts with 0 V bias across diode.
* `save outf=diode.str` → saves structure for later visualization.
* `log outf=diode2.log` → saves electrical results (I-V data).
* Sweep applied voltage:

  * Cathode fixed at 0 V.
  * Anode swept from **-3 V → +3 V** in steps of 0.1 V.
  * This produces the **I–V characteristics** of the PN junction.

---

6. Simulation (biasing)

Now we test the diode:

Start with 0 V (no voltage).

Keep cathode = 0 V always.

Sweep anode voltage from -3 V to +3 V, step by step (0.1 V each).

👉 This gives us the I–V curve of the diode (current vs voltage graph).
## 🔹 Step 7: Device Geometry (Diagram You Shared)

You also included a diagram showing:

* **Length = 10 µm, Width = 4 µm**.
* **Top half (y=2–4 µm): N-type silicon.**
* **Bottom half (y=0–2 µm): P-type silicon.**
* Electrodes:

  * Top electrode = Anode.
  * Bottom electrode = Cathode.

👉 This matches perfectly with the ATLAS code.

---

## ✅ Final Summary

This ATLAS input file builds a **2D PN junction diode** with:

* Dimensions: **10 µm × 4 µm**.
* Doping: **P = 5e15 cm⁻³**, **N = 1e16 cm⁻³**.
* Contacts: **Anode (top)**, **Cathode (bottom)**.
* Simulation: Performs **I–V sweep** from **-3 V to +3 V** to get diode characteristics.

Got it 👍 Let me rewrite your whole lecture in **easy, clear language** so you can quickly understand how to extract and analyze results in ATLAS/TonyPlot.

---

## 📊 How to Extract Results in ATLAS/TonyPlot

1. **After the simulation finishes**

   * The results (structure + electrical data) open in a tool called **TonyPlot**.
   * This shows both the **device structure** (geometry, doping, etc.) and the **electrical curves** (I–V, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Viewing I–V Characteristics

* **Right click → Display**
* You will see two options:

  * **X quantity** → What to plot on the horizontal axis (example: Voltage).
  * **Y quantity** → What to plot on the vertical axis (example: Current).

👉 If we select **Voltage on X** and **Current on Y**, we get the **I–V curve of the diode**.

* In the I–V curve:

  * At **positive voltage (forward bias)** → current rises quickly.
  * At **negative voltage (reverse bias)** → current stays nearly zero (very small leakage).

⚡ **Turn-on Voltage**:

* Use the **Ruler icon** to click on the point where current starts rising.
* For silicon diode, this is \~ **0.7 V**.

---

### 🔹 Viewing Device Structure

* Click on **Structure files** → opens a new page.
* The structure window shows the **2D device**:

  * X-axis = 0 to 10 µm (length).
  * Y-axis = 0 to 4 µm (height).
* Top half = N-type silicon.
* Bottom half = P-type silicon.
* Middle = **junction region**.

---

### 🔹 Viewing Physical Quantities

From the **top menu**, you can select different physical parameters to visualize, such as:

* **Electric field** (total, horizontal, vertical).
* **Electron concentration**.
* **Hole concentration**.

👉 Example:

* Select **Total Electric Field**.
* You’ll notice the field is highest near the **junction** → this is the **depletion region** (region with no free carriers, only immobile ions).

---

### 🔹 Changing Display Format

* By default, values are shown on a **logarithmic scale**.
* To switch:

  * Go to **Display → Define → Contours**.
  * Choose **linear scale** instead of logarithmic.
  * You can also set min/max limits for better visualization.
* Color maps can be changed too (blue→red, red→green, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Extracting 1D Profiles (Cutlines)

* Use the **Cutline tool** (icon on toolbar).
* Draw a **vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line** across the device.
* This gives a **1D plot** of the chosen quantity (e.g., electron concentration vs. position).

---

### 🔹 Probe Tool

* Use the **Probe icon**.
* Click on any point in the device → shows **values of quantities at that location** (like electron concentration, electric field, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Saving Figures

* Go to **File → Export Image**.
* Choose format (PNG, JPG, etc.) and resolution.
* Save to a chosen path.

---

✅ **In summary:**

* **TonyPlot** helps visualize **I–V characteristics**, **device structure**, and **physical parameters** like electric field and carrier concentration.
* You can switch between **2D maps, 1D profiles, and point values**.
* Tools:

  * **Ruler** → measure turn-on voltage.
  * **Cutline** → get 1D profiles.
  * **Probe** → values at a point.
  * **Export** → save graphs and figures.

Great! Let's walk through this **Silvaco DeckBuild simulation** of a **Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)** step by step, using **simple and easy language**.

---

### 💡 **What Is a BJT?**

A **BJT** (Bipolar Junction Transistor) is a **3-layer** semiconductor device used for amplification and switching. It has **3 regions**:

* **Emitter (E)** — Injects charge carriers.
* **Base (B)** — Very thin and lightly doped.
* **Collector (C)** — Collects the carriers from emitter.

---

### 🧠 **What Kind of BJT?**

From your notes and code, you're working with an **NPN transistor**, where:

* **Emitter (Region 4):** N-type, **heavily doped** → High current injection.
* **Base (Region 3):** P-type, **lightly doped** and thin → Allows control.
* **Collector (Regions 1 & 2):** N-type, **moderately doped** → Collects current.

---

### 🧪 **What Is Being Simulated?**

You're analyzing how the **collector current (Ic)** changes with different **base voltages (Vb)**, while sweeping the **collector voltage (Vc)**.

---

### 📄 **Understanding the Code (Input Deck)**

#### ⚙️ General Format:

```plaintext
solve init
log outf=transistorX.log

solve v1=0 v2=Y v3=0 vstep=0.01 vfinal=0.5 name=collector

save outf=transistorX.str
```

#### 🔍 What This Means:

| Line                                      | Explanation                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `solve init`                              | Initialize the simulation                                                                    |
| `log outf=...`                            | Log the simulation data to a file                                                            |
| `solve v1=0 v2=Y v3=0 ... name=collector` | Apply voltages: v1 = emitter, v2 = base, v3 = unused; sweep collector voltage from 0 to 0.5V |
| `vstep=0.01`                              | Increase collector voltage in steps of 0.01V                                                 |
| `name=collector`                          | This sweep is applied to the collector contact                                               |
| `log off`                                 | Stop logging                                                                                 |
| `save outf=...`                           | Save the structure file                                                                      |

---

### 📊 **Multiple Simulations**

You're running **3 simulations** with different base voltages:

| Transistor  | Base Voltage (Vb) | Output File     |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| transistor1 | 0.2 V             | transistor1.log |
| transistor2 | 0.3 V             | transistor2.log |
| transistor3 | 0.4 V             | transistor3.log |

The **collector voltage (Vc)** is swept from **0 to 0.5V** in **0.01V steps** for all three.

---

### 📈 **How to View Results**

1. **Run the Simulation**

   * Press the "play" button in DeckBuild.

2. **View Output Graphs**

   * Go to **File → Overlay** to compare all 3 logs.
   * X-axis: Collector Voltage (Vc)
   * Y-axis: Collector Current (Ic)

3. **Observation**

   * As **base voltage increases**, the **collector current increases**.
   * This is expected from BJT behavior.

---

### 🔬 **More Analysis – Displaying Currents**

You can also see:

* **Emitter Current (Ie)**
* **Base Current (Ib)**
* **Collector Current (Ic)**

From the display options:

* **Red = Emitter Current**
* **Green = Base Current**
* **Blue = Collector Current**

👉 **Observation**: Ic ≈ Ie, and Ib is much smaller → This shows the transistor is amplifying current.

---

### 📐 **Calculate Current Gain (β or hFE)**

**Current Gain (β)** = Collector Current / Base Current

Steps:

1. In **Display**, click on the **Functions** icon.
2. Create a new variable:

   * Name: `current_gain`
   * Formula: `collector_current / base_current`
   * Unit: None (dimensionless)
3. Click **OK**, and then display the current gain.
4. Result: β is around **18.5 to 20**, which is typical.

---

### 🧱 **Structure Visualization**

You can also view:

* **Transistor Regions** (Emitter, Base, Collector)
* **Electric Field**
* **Electron and Hole Current Densities**

#### Key Observations:

* **Electron current** is high near emitter and collector.
* **Hole current** is mainly in the base region.
* This shows that **both electrons and holes** are involved → "Bipolar".
